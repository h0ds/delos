# Oracle: The AI Research Agent Concept

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** January 20, 2026

---

## Overview

Oracle is not just a tool. It's an AI-powered research agent that continuously monitors market situations and surfaces intelligence traders need to make faster decisions.

### The Mental Model

Instead of thinking "I'm looking at a dashboard," think:

*"I have an AI research assistant working 24/7. It monitors everything. When I ask it a question, it provides analyzed findings with full context. It never gets tired. It never misses critical signals. It shows me what I need to know, when I need to know it."*

That's Oracle.

## Oracle's Workflow

### 1. Monitor
Oracle continuously watches multiple signal sources:
- NewsAPI (breaking news)
- Google News RSS (broad coverage)
- Reddit (community signals)
- (Future: Twitter, TradingView, Bloomberg)

### 2. Analyze
Every signal is analyzed for:
- **Sentiment** — Is this bullish, bearish, or neutral?
- **Impact** — How much could this move markets? (0-1 score)
- **Relevance** — Which markets does this affect?
- **Recency** — When did this happen?
- **Source** — Who reported this? (credibility)

### 3. Surface
Oracle presents findings:
- **Critical signals** are highlighted immediately
- **Significant signals** are grouped
- **Minor signals** are available if needed
- **All signals** are cited and verified

### 4. Alert
When critical signals arrive:
- Dashboard updates in real-time
- Visual indicators show urgency
- Sound/notification options (future)
- Email/Slack alerts (future)

### 5. Support
Oracle provides tools for decisions:
- Sentiment distribution charts
- Impact breakdown visualizations
- Timeline of signal flow (24h)
- Source credibility analysis
- Related market tracking

## Oracle vs. Traditional Tools

### vs. News Websites
```
News Website:
  → "Breaking: Federal Reserve Raises Rates"
  → User must evaluate: Is this bullish or bearish?
  → User must analyze: Which markets are affected?
  → User must act: What do I do with this?

Oracle:
  → Signal: "Federal Reserve Raises Rates"
  → Sentiment: Bearish (negative for growth stocks)
  → Impact: Critical (affects all markets)
  → Markets: SPX, TECH, BTC
  → Assessment: "Market may sell off short-term"
  → User acts: Prepared with context
```

### vs. Stock Trading Platforms
```
Platform:
  → Shows price charts
  → Shows order book
  → Shows your portfolio
  → You do the research

Oracle:
  → Shows market signals
  → Shows sentiment/impact
  → Shows related developments
  → Oracle provides the research
```

### vs. Manual Research
```
Manual Research:
  → Search Google: "bitcoin news"
  → Read 10+ articles (30+ minutes)
  → Synthesize yourself
  → Make decision
  → Miss events while researching

Oracle:
  → Ask Oracle about bitcoin
  → Get analyzed findings (30 seconds)
  → Critical signals highlighted
  → Related markets shown
  → Act immediately
```

## Core Oracle Features

### 1. Intelligence Layer

Oracle doesn't just show data. It adds intelligence:

```
Raw Signal:
  → "US Non-Farm Payroll: 250K (Expected: 200K)"

Oracle Analysis:
  → Surprise: +25% (beat expectations)
  → Sentiment: Bullish (strong jobs)
  → Impact: High (affects Fed decisions)
  → Markets: SPX, US Dollar, Bonds
  → Assessment: "Stronger labor market supports rate hikes"
```

### 2. Real-Time Monitoring

Oracle is always working:
- Monitors 3 sources simultaneously
- Processes signals in real-time
- Updates dashboard instantly
- Surfaces critical findings immediately

### 3. Context at a Glance

Every signal includes:
- What (the headline)
- When (timestamp)
- Where (market relevance)
- Why (impact score)
- How (sentiment indicator)
- Who (source credibility)

### 4. Confidence Scoring

Oracle shows how confident it is:
- Sentiment confidence (0.0-1.0)
- Impact confidence (based on keyword matches)
- Relevance confidence (market correlation)
- Overall assessment quality

### 5. Trend Analysis

Oracle identifies patterns:
- Sentiment trends (is the market getting more bullish?)
- Impact clustering (multiple signals pointing same direction?)
- Source consensus (do multiple sources agree?)
- Time-based patterns (when do critical signals occur?)
